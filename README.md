# Shrefa

Shrefa is a simulation-based web application that integrates a **React frontend**, an **Express (Node.js) backend**, and a **Python-powered simulation engine**. The project is designed to efficiently compute and visualize complex simulations, utilizing a structured and scalable architecture.

## Project Structure

- **frontend_node** – Handles the user interface using **React** and **MUI**, rendering the simulation and interacting with the backend.
- **backend_node** – Serves as the API layer using **Express** and connects to an **SQLite database** for persistent data storage.
- **backend_py** – Manages the core simulation logic, performing intensive computations and providing results via a **Flask API**.

## Vision

Shrefa is built to offer a seamless way to interact with large-scale simulations through an optimized backend pipeline. The **frontend** delivers a smooth and responsive UI, while **Node.js** efficiently manages API calls, authentication, and database interactions. **Python** ensures high-performance calculations, keeping computational workloads separate from UI concerns.

The goal is to create a system where users can effortlessly run, visualize, and store simulation data while maintaining a modular and adaptable codebase.
